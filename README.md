 >  I am studying the correlation between education spending and economic inequality in Africa in order to understand how human capital investment can alleviate inequality. I am using education spending as % of GDP and the Gini coefficient as my variables.

## Data Review

#### B. Social spending on education and its impact on inequality

##### Theory:
* The neoclassical theory brings up the notion that income inequality is a consequence of unequal investments in human capital. An appropriate proxy for measuring human capital is education. The premise is that the more time is spent in school, the more human capital a person can accumulate. By having higher human capital, a worker’s productivity increases, resulting in higher earnings. However, spending on college education versus primary education has different impacts on income inequality as will be later explained. By spending more on primary education, the government can provide everyone with a fair chance at being literate, an important end in itself.

##### Data source: 
1. [UNESCO Institute of Statistics Education Finance](http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Pages/education-finance.aspx): assess global, regional and country spending patterns, links between funding and outcomes, and the impact of global financial fluctuations on education. The main priority is Sub-Saharan Africa.    

2. [WIID - World Inequality Database](https://www.wider.unu.edu/project/wiid-world-income-inequality-database): includes fully documented Gini coefficients and decile and quintile distributions for 44 SSA countries, often for long periods of time.  Only good quality data rated ‘1’ or ‘2’ are used safely in trend and regression analysis.

##### Questions:
###### Technical Questions:
1. What is a more effective indicator for measuring education spending? - as % of GDP, or as % of total government expenditure, or $ per student?
2. Is there a better / more comprehensive data source than UNESCO for education financing data? 

###### Context Questions:
1. What is the main source of education financing in Sub-Saharan Africa? ![alt text](https://github.com/nancyzhao888/major-studio-1/blob/master/Education%20Financing%20Flow.png "Logo Title Text 1")
2. According to most reports, public education spending in Africa has been increasing every year (total % of GDP puts Africa in the top three in the world). However, in one-third of the region's countries, half of the kids still do not complete primary education. Why is that? Where does the money go?
3. What does the African government prioritize to fund first? - Primary or secondary schools? Textbooks or teacher salaries? And what do you care more about, expanding access or improving the quality of education?
4. Does devoting more resources to education affect the distribution of income or does the level of income inequality affect the amount of resources devoted to public education?

#### A. Education & Inequality
1. causality between education drop-out and economic inequality
2. poor education quality

##### Data Sources
1. The World Bank - [World Development Indicators](www.data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators)
2. UNESCO Institute of Statistics:
* [Out-of-School Children](http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Pages/out-of-school-children.aspx): identify out-of-school children, monitor progress towards universal primary education, measure the scope of and assess the reasons for exclusion
3. TIMSS: The TIMSS is an ongoing cross-country standardized testing instrument, which measures mathematics and physics competence in-country, at various levels of the schooling system. Specifically, [The South African component of TIMSS](www.timss-sa.org.za) has been assessing mathematics and science achievement among Grade 8 and 9 learners since 1995.

[The Brookings Institute’s Africa Learning Barometer](https://www.brookings.edu/interactives/africa-learning-barometer): It's an interactive feature that analyzes the state of education and learning in sub-Saharan Africa through four indicators: school enrollment, school completion, quality of education and education inequality.

##### Questions
* How does the African school system work?
* What are the barriers / thresholds for kids to 1) enter primary schools and 2) continue education? - Money?
* Does education inequality vary across Africa? - And its correlation with local economic inequality.
