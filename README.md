### Education Financing and Inequality in Sub-Saharan African Countries
 
#### Description 
Education is a form of human capital investment that is central to economic growth and reduce income inequality. This interactive breakdown of public, private and aid expenditures on each education level looks at how much education funding one student receives on average, and aims to examine the impact of such investment on inequality.
 
#### Research Question 
> I am studying the relationship between education spending by education level and economic inequality in Africa in order to understand how human capital investment in different levels of schooling can help alleviate inequality. I am using government / household / foreign aid education expenditure as % of GDP by education level and the Gini coefficient as my variables. My [visualization](nancyzhao888.github.io/major-studio-1/master/exercises/undp.presentation) is based on UNESCO Education Finance, UNESCO IIEP Pôle de Dakar, OECD Creditor Reporting System and IID-SSA data."

## Data Review

#### B. Social spending on education and its impact on inequality

##### Theory:
* The neoclassical theory brings up the notion that income inequality is a consequence of unequal investments in human capital. An appropriate proxy for measuring human capital is education. The premise is that the more time is spent in school, the more human capital a person can accumulate. By having higher human capital, a worker’s productivity increases, resulting in higher earnings. However, spending on college education versus primary education has different impacts on income inequality as will be later explained. By spending more on primary education, the government can provide everyone with a fair chance at being literate, an important end in itself.

##### Data source: 
1. [UNESCO Institute of Statistics Education Finance](http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Pages/education-finance.aspx): assess global, regional and country spending patterns, links between funding and outcomes, and the impact of global financial fluctuations on education. The main priority is Sub-Saharan Africa.    

2. [UNESCO IIEP Pôle de Dakar Indicator Database](https://www.iipe-poledakar.org/en/indicateurs-en/indicator-database)

3. [OECD Creditor Reporting System](http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?QueryId=58197#)

4. [WIID - World Inequality Database](https://www.wider.unu.edu/project/wiid-world-income-inequality-database): includes fully documented Gini coefficients and decile and quintile distributions for 44 SSA countries, often for long periods of time.  Only good quality data rated ‘1’ or ‘2’ are used safely in trend and regression analysis.

##### Questions:
###### Technical Questions:
1. What is a more effective indicator for measuring education spending? - as % of GDP, or as % of total government expenditure, or $ per student?
2. Is there a better / more comprehensive data source than UNESCO for education financing data? 

###### Context Questions:
1. What is the main source of education financing in Sub-Saharan Africa? ![alt text](https://github.com/nancyzhao888/major-studio-1/blob/master/Education%20Financing%20Flow.png "Logo Title Text 1")
2. According to most reports, public education spending in Africa has been increasing every year (total % of GDP puts Africa in the top three in the world). However, in one-third of the region's countries, half of the kids still do not complete primary education. Why is that? Where does the money go?
3. What does the African government prioritize to fund first? - Primary or secondary schools? Textbooks or teacher salaries? And what do you care more about, expanding access or improving the quality of education?
4. Does devoting more resources to education affect the distribution of income or does the level of income inequality affect the amount of resources devoted to public education?
